The challenge should be related to "${skill}" with a difficulty level of "${difficulty}".

Please include the following in JSON format:
1. title: A clear, concise title for the challenge
2. description: A detailed explanation of the problem with proper formatting (can include HTML)
3. difficulty: The challenge difficulty ("${difficulty}")
4. category: A specific subcategory within "${skill}"
5. constraints: An array of constraints or limitations
6. examples: An array of example cases with input, output, and explanation
7. testCases: An array of test cases (including both visible and hidden tests) with input, expectedOutput, and isHidden properties
8. hints: An array of progressive hints (from general to specific)
9. timeComplexity: Expected time complexity (e.g., "O(n)")
10. spaceComplexity: Expected space complexity (e.g., "O(1)")

Make sure test cases are comprehensive and cover edge cases. Provide at least 5 test cases, with 2-3 of them marked as hidden.
The problem should be clearly stated, challenging for the given difficulty level, and solvable.

TEST CASES:
${testCasesData}

Your task:
1. Act as a language interpreter to run the provided code against each test case
2. For each test case, determine if the code produces the expected output
3. Capture any errors or exceptions that might occur
4. Provide helpful error messages where applicable

Return a JSON object with:
1. "output": a console-like output of running the code
2. "testResults": an array of results, one for each test case, where each result has:
   - "input": the input value
   - "expected": the expected output
   - "actual": the actual output produced by the code
   - "passed": boolean indicating if the test passed
   - "error": any error message if applicable (null if no error)
${
  mode === "submit"
    ? `3. "feedback": constructive feedback about the solution`
    : ""

IMPORTANT:
- Be precise in checking outputs, considering type and format
- Account for language-specific behaviors
- Focus on functionality matching the expected outputs
- Format your response as valid JSON only (no additional text)

STUDENT'S CODE (${language}):

Your task:
1. Analyze the student's code to identify issues or areas for improvement
2. Do NOT provide a complete solution
3. Give a helpful, personalized hint that guides them toward solving the problem
4. The hint should be specific to what they've written so far
5. Focus on one key insight or improvement they need to make

Guidelines:
- Be encouraging and supportive
- If their code is on the right track, acknowledge that
- If they're stuck or going in the wrong direction, gently redirect them
- Your hint should help them learn, not just solve the problem

Return ONLY the hint text without any additional context or explanation.
